# Test

Repository to test the trees API limits. Best described limits are sadly NOT in the documentation, but in https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/23748#discussioncomment-3241615

Normally you will not run into these limits. Sadly there isn't any paging availble in case you DO run into it, in case of this insane repository :)
